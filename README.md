Fast rsync-like tool for incrementally copying files. Runs natively on both Windows and Linux and uses network for communication, to maximise speed when syncing between Windows and WSL filesystems.

Notes on performance & security
===============================

Some perf results of walking directories on each OS:

   Host ->       Windows     Linux
Filesystem:
  Windows        100k        9k
   Linux          1k         500k

Conclusion => accessing WSL filesytem from Windows or vice-versa is slow, so we use native access.

Transferring data through the stdin/stdout of ssh is pretty slow (on Windows at least),
at most about 20MB/s. It's nice and secure though (we get authentication and encryption).

A faster option would be to use ssh's port forwarding so that we can use a separate TCP
connection. Testing on Windows showed this could peak at around 200MB/s. We lose some of the
security though, as anybody can connect to the tunnel.

The best for performance is a direct TCP connection (without ssh), which peaks at around 2GB/s
locally on Windows. We can use ssh for the initial setup, sharing some kind of secret key
so that each side of the connection is secure.

Tree representation
===================

There are some interesting design questions that arise about how to handle trees of files and folders,
for example whether two files should be considered equal if they have the same contents but different names.
If the answer is yes then it seems that the name shouldn't be part of the file itself, but is instead
used as an identifier _for_ the file. The same thing applies to folders. This seems to be the most
consistent view on the matter. This means that the program makes the destination object (file, folder etc.)
be the same as the source object, and that doesn't mean they need to have the same name.

There are several ambiguities about how to sync depending on whether the paths given exist, if they have a trailing
slash, etc or if they are a file or a folder. The goal is that the program should be intuitive and easy to use and
easy to reason about its behaviour. The current plan is to behave as follows:

Each row is for a different type of source that the source path points to (something that doesn't exist, an
existing file or an existing folder). Each column is for a different type of dest that the dest path points to.
Each row/col is further broken down into versions that include or do not include a trailing slash on the path.
The cell contents describe the behaviour given those inputs:
   - 'X' means this is an error
   - 'b' means that the source is copied over to the path b, creating, updating or replacing whatever might be there.
   - 'b/a' means that the source is copied over to the path b/a, creating, updating or replacing whatever might be there.
   - '*' indicates that the behaviour might be surprising/destructive because it deletes an existing file or folder and replaces it
        with a folder/file. We should probably warn for this.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|          Dest ->    |  Non-existent |      File     |    Folder     |
|                     |---------------|---------------|---------------|
|  Source v           |   b   |  b/   |   b   |  b/   |   b   |  b/   |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|              src/a  |               |               |               |
| Non-existent        |       X       |       X       |       X       |
|              src/a/ |               |               |               |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|              src/a  |   b   |  b/a  |   b   |   X   |   b*  |  b/a  |
| File                |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|              src/a/ |   X   |   X   |   X   |   X   |   X   |   X   |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|              src/a  |   b   |   b   |   b*  |   X   |   b   |   b   |
| Folder              |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|              src/a/ |   b   |   b   |   b*  |   X   |   b   |   b   |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|

The behaviour can be summarised as a "golden rule" which is that after the sync, the object pointed to by the destination path will be identical to the object pointed to by the source path, i.e. `tree $SRC == tree $DEST`.

There is one exception, which is that if the dest path has a trailing slash, and source is an (existing) file, then the dest path is first modified to have the final part of the source path appended to it. e.g.:

`rjrssync folder/file.txt backup/` => `backup/file.txt`

This makes it more ergonomic to copy individual files. Unfortunately it makes the behaviour of files and folder inconsistent, but this this is fine because files and folders are indeed different, and it's worth the sacrifice.

It has the property that non-existent dest files/folders are treated the same as if they did exist, which means that you get a consistent final state no matter the starting state (behaviour is idempotent).

It also prevents unintended creation of nested folders with the same name which can be annoying, e.g.

`rjrssync src/folder dest/folder` => `dest/folder/...` (rather than `dest/folder/folder/...`)

Trailing slashes on files are always invalid, because this gives the impression that the file is actually a folder, and so could lead to unexpected behaviour.

Symlinks are treated the same as files, because that's essentially how rjrssync treats symlinks (it syncs 
the link address, as if it was a small text file). Therefore they can't have trailing slashes.
Note that tab-completion (on bash and cmd at least) does not put a trailing slash on symlinks automatically,
so this shouldn't be a problem. (For folders, bash does do this which is why it's useful to allow trailing
slashes on folder names).

Note though that on Linux, the OS treats a trailing slash on a symlink to refer to the _target_
of the symlink, not the symlink itself, and so rjrssync doesn't actually see these as symlinks at all.

Notes on symlinks
==================

Symlinks could be present as ancestors in the path(s) being synced (`a/b/symlink/c`),
the path being synced itself (`a/b/symlink`, one or both sides), or as one of the items inside a folder being synced.

Symlinks can point to either a file, a folder, nothing (broken), or another symlink, which itself could point to any of those.

Symlinks can cause cycles and DAGs, including pointing to itself. This shouldn't be too important for us,
as we (generally) never follow symlinks and so will never observe these cases.

On Windows, a symlink is either a "file symlink" or "directory symlink" (specified on creation),
whereas on Linux it is simply a symlink. A "directory symlink" that points to a file (possibly via other symlinks) or a "file symlink" that points to a directory is considered broken (similar to the target not existing at all).

It is possible to create an invalid symlink (target is the wrong 'type' or doesn't exist)

Symlink targets can be specified as relative or absolute.

Symlinks have their own modified time (which is when the link path was changed, not equal to the target's modified time), but we don't use as we can compare the link target instead (we don't have this luxury when
syncing files, because their contents might be huge, but a link target is small).

There can be multiple symlinks followed in a path being synced, e.g. <ROOT>/symlink1/folder2/symlink3/file,
but this would only be observed if rjrssync was unaware of symlinks (otherwise it would never walk into the first symlink), so we can't actually encounter this.

This crate has some useful explanation of some of these concepts: https://crates.io/crates/symlink.

The target link address on Windows might contain backslashes, which would need converting when sending over to Linux. The other way round should be fine, because Windows supports forward slashes too.

rjrssync treats symlinks as if they were simple text files containing their target address.
They are not (generally) followed or validated. They will be reproduced as accurately as possible on
the destination.
Note that this only applies to symlinks that are part of the sync (including as the root);
symlinks that are ancestors of the path provided as source or dest will always be followed in order
to get to the transfer root.

Known quirks with the current behaviour:

Existing windows symlink on the dest side, and then a broken Unix symlink on the source side, with the same target link address: 
Currently this will result in an error, as we will attempt to create a Generic symlink on the dest, which will fail. In this case it's pretty likely that the user would prefer us to simply leave the dest symlink as it is
(whether it be a file or folder symlink).

Trailing slashes on symlinks are handled different on Windows and Linux, see above section on trailing slashes
for details.


It was considered for rjrssync to have two 'modes', as to whether it ignores the symlinks (treats them as
their targets) or syncs them as the links. However it was decided against this because of the increase in
complexity of the testing and some quirky behaviour in the "unaware" mode (see below):

Quirks of unaware mode:

On Linux, if there's a symlink to a folder and we're in unaware mode, then we won't be able to delete it because on Linux, deleting a symlink has to be done via remove_file, not remove_dir. However when in unaware mode, we see it as a dir, and so use remove_dir.

When deleting a symlink folder and we're in unaware model, the whole symlink *target* folder will be cleared out too, as well as deleting the symlink itself. This is somewhat surprising, but has to be the case because rjrssync is unaware that it is deleting stuff through a symlink.


Example spec file
===================

```
# Defaults to local path, if no remote hostname is specified
# src_hostname: computer1
# src_username: root
dest_hostname: computer2
dest_username: myuser
syncs:
  - src: D:/Source
    dest: D:/Dest
    exclude: [ "\.txt" ]
  - src: D:/Source
    dest: D:/Dest2
```

TODO:
=====

Interface
----------

* Could have some kind of hierarchy of filters, so can exclude something without continuing to evaluate other filters?
* Perhaps could have hard/soft includes/excludes - soft would keep evaluating other filters which may change the decision, hard would stop evaluating and keep that as the final decision.
* If a dir is excluded by the filters (after resolving all filters), then we don't walk inside that dir, so stuff inside it will be excluded *even if the filters would have matched them*. Document this?
* --dry-run (and the same for -v) should make it clearer exactly what is being copied to where, e.g. give absolute paths. If there is a long path up to the root (or afterwards), could shorten it with ellipses, e.g. "Copying T:\work\...\bob\folder\...\thing.txt to X:\backups\...\newbackup\folder\...\thing.txt"
* Option to override the "dest file is newer" error
* Should filters expect to see trailing slashes on folder names or not? What about folder symlinks?

Remote launching
----------------

* Additional SSH options as command-line arguments (separate for source and dest?)
* SSH host key verification prompt doesn't echo the user's typing, but it does seem to work anyway
* Sometimes remote processes are left orphaned, preventing new ones from listening on the same port
* Using temporary dir means that rebooting the remote will mean we have to rebuild from scratch (on Linux)
* Sometimes see "ssh stderr: mesg: ttyname failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device" when deploying to remote. Can we hide this using "-T" for example?
* "WARN  | rjrssync::boss_launch: Remote server has incompatible version (51 vs local version 53)" - maybe say that we will try deploying as part of this?

Syncing logic
-------------

* Compare and sync file permissions?
* Modified time:
    - need to account for time zone differences etc. between source and dest when updating the timestamp
    - would this play nicely with other tools (e.g. build systems) that check timestamps - it might think that it doesn't need to rebuild anything, as the new timestamp for this file is still really old?
    - Maybe instead we could store something else, like a hash or our own marker to indicate when this file was synced, so that the timestamp is "correct", but we know not to sync it again next time.
* Testing for sync logic, including between different combinations of windows and linux, remote and local etc.
   - Filters, and how they work on normalized paths between windows and linux.
   - Between different OSes,to make sure the path normalisation works
* Test for --dry-run
* Test for --stats (maybe just all the command-line options...)
* Progress bar
* symlinks - Clarify/document/test the program's behaviour in all the cases described in the above symlink notes
* What happens if src and dest both point to the same place?
   - Either directly, or via symlink(s)?
* --no-encryption option, might be faster?
* How to handle case when want to copy two different folders into the same destination, some sort of --no-delete?
* Use of SystemTime
   -  is this compatible between platforms, time zone changes, precision differences, etc. etc.
   - can we safely serialize this on one platform and deserialize on another?
* Consider warning for unexpected deletions (esp with replacing files with folders, see table in above section)



Performance
------------

* Investigate if parallelising some stages would speed it up, e.g. walking the dir structure on multiple threads, or sending data across network on multiple threads
   - Could have one thread just doing filesystem calls to fill up a queue, and another thread processing those entries.
   - Maybe check if WalkDir is slow, by comparing its performance with direct std::fs stuff or even native OS stuff?
* Parallelise querying  - see parallel-query branch
* Investigate if pipelining some stages would speed it up, e.g. sending file list while also sending it
* Probably better to batch together File() Responses, to avoid overhead from sending loads of messages
* Perf comparison with regular rsync (for cases where there are zero or few changes, and for cases with more changes)
* Performance tests, so we know if we've made something slower
  - Syncing large tree when nothing has changed
  - Copying single large file
  - Copying lots of small files
* Separate remote doers onto separate processes in Chrome
* Sync time between boss and remote doers - Sync remote and local by setting remote zero equal to the time at which we receivr the first signs of life from the doer?



Misc
-----

* Make GitHub actions run on both Windows and Linux.
* Configure GitHub actions to run with remote hosts somehow
* piper and tcper maybe shouldn't be in the `bin/` folder, as then they count as part of the proper program,
but they should just be for testing/investigation. Maybe should be a separate crate?
* On work PC this fails:
`cargo run D:\TempSource\ robhug01@localhost:/home/robhug01/TempDest -v`
ERROR | rjrssync::boss_frontend: Sync error: Unexpected response from dest GetEntries: Ok(Error("normalize_path failed: Illegal characters in path"))
* Improve compile times. Is it the RustEmbed crate? Maybe the debug-embed feature of the crate could help?
* Maybe should extend test framework to support doing things remotely, like saving and loading filesystem nodes, making and clearing out a temporary folder etc.
* Upload to crates.io, so that we can "cargo install" from anywhere?
* Warning if filter doesn't match anything, possibly after GetEntries but before actually doing anything (to prevent mistaken filter?)
* Running remote tests in parallel seems to cause hangs
